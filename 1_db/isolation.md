### This code snippet demonstrates the usage of PostgreSQL isolation levels.

Isolation levels in PostgreSQL determine the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from others. The available isolation levels are:

- Read Uncommitted: Allows dirty reads, meaning a transaction can read uncommitted data from other transactions.
- Read Committed: Ensures that a transaction only sees committed data from other transactions.
- Repeatable Read: Guarantees that a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database, even if other transactions are modifying the data.
- Serializable: Provides the highest level of isolation, ensuring that transactions are executed in a serializable order, as if they were executed one after another.

By setting the appropriate isolation level, you can control the trade-off between data consistency and concurrency in your application.

Note: It's important to choose the right isolation level based on your application's requirements to avoid issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
